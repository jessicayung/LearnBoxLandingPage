[custom_headline type="left" level="h2" looks_like="h3" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;"]Why we were Founded[/custom_headline]
[gap size="30px"]
[column type="1"]
<p class="mbn" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">
No one will doubt the importance of early childhood learning, and responsible pedagogy. enables each child to demonstrate learning in the fullest sense.

<p class="mbn" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">However, the problem many of us are facing is that we are busy working parents or that there is a lack of language or specific skills or know-how or we simply need a break. Furthermore, with a growing population, the competition for quality education at kindergartens and primary schools is high.</p>

<p class="mbn" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">LearnBox was founded on the belief that one-to-one tutoring can benefit young children, and that it can provide an exciting and stimulating experience. We hope to expose them to opportunities that would allow them to flourish in many aspects of their development.</p>
[gap size="10px"]
<p class="mbn" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">In fact, the moment your child is born, he/she is already learning and parents / carers are already tutoring. No two children are the same - individual tutoring allows teaching to be tailor-made to suit the needs of your child.</p>

[column type="1"]
<p class="mbn" style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">Marketing oneself, scheduling and rescheduling (and getting last-minute cancellations), and keeping track of student details can be draining. LearnBox seeks to simplify this process and let your performance do the marketing for you.</p>

<p class="mbn" style="text-align: left;">Jessica (University of Cambridge) was educated at Diocesan Girls’s School (DGS) and DGJS before continuing Sixth Form at Westminster School, London. At school, she was recipient of English and Mathematics prizes, served as Form Prefect and School Monitor, and was a strong member of the Debating Team, Chamber Choir, and percussion ensemble. She was commended with a Gold Medal in the British Physics Olympiad, and won the UK Senior Team Maths Challenge as well as national debating competitions in Hong Kong and the UK.</p>
[gap size="10px"]
<p class="mbn" style="text-align: left;">Jessica has experience teaching maths, coding, and debating. She first became passionate about early education when she taught coding at an international school in Hong Kong. She noticed how young children loved to explore and search for explanations, and realised how important having good teachers was in helping them grow. Jessica sees learning in early childhood as the building of a strong foundation for later life. She takes pride in taking part in the grooming of each child's individual talents, wherever they may lie.</p>
